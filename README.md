# Lucky Name Number

This program calcuates your fortune based on your name. I made this for GCSE WJEC Controlled Assessment and thought I'd upload it. It was written in Python 3.4, but it should probably work with Python 3.x. Feel free to improve to fork and all that, I won't be using this any time soon.
